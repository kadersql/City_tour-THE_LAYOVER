**App details **

As any user to the website, 
I need to be able to search through a list of curated 
landmarks within the region so that I can see which 
locations can be visited.

**Search Criteria include:**

proximity (city initially, but potentially distance)
category of landmark (i.e. food, park, sports/entertainment, etc.)

**As a City Visitor**
I need to be able to generate 
a travel route that matches my itinerary so that I 
know where to go.

**A travel route includes:**
Starting point (origination)
Directions to each landmark (based on the order added to my itinerary)
Google Embeded API also going to show live travel route in map with 
walking mode beside driving.
